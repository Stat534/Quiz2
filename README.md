# Quiz2

For this quiz you will need to clone the repo and create an R markdown file using the [github_document type](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html). Answer the questions below and make sure to include both the .Rmd and .md files in your repo.

#### Q1. (5 points)
For each type of spatial data: point process, point referenced, and areal data, give an example of datasets that you'd enjoy working on. This does not need to be the dataset itself, but if you have a link that would be great, but for instance if you are a sports fan you might be interested in treating a [basketball shot chart] (http://graphics.latimes.com/kobe-every-shot-ever/) as a point process data set.

#### Q2. (5 points)
Using `ggplot2`, create figure that contains a homogenous point process.
